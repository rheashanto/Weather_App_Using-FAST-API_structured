# fast_api

This project was generated using fastapi_template.

## UV

This project uses uv. It's a modern dependency management
tool.

To run the project use this set of commands:

```bash
uv sync --locked
uv run -m fast_api
```

This will start the server on the configured host.

You can find swagger documentation at `/api/docs`.

You can read more about uv here: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/

## Docker

You can start the project with docker using this command:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This command exposes the web application on port 8000, mounts current directory and enables autoreload.

But you have to rebuild image every time you modify `uv.lock` or `pyproject.toml` with this command:

```bash
docker compose build
```

## Project structure

```

## Configuration

This application can be configured with environment variables.

You can create `.env` file in the root directory and place all
environment variables here. 

All environment variables should start with "FAST_API_" prefix.

For example if you see in your "fast_api/settings.py" a variable named like
`random_parameter`, you should provide the "FAST_API_RANDOM_PARAMETER" 
variable to configure the value. This behaviour can be changed by overriding `env_prefix` property
in `fast_api.settings.Settings.Config`.

An example of .env file:
```bash
FAST_API_RELOAD="True"
FAST_API_PORT="8000"
FAST_API_ENVIRONMENT="dev"
```

You can read more about BaseSettings class here: https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/

## Pre-commit

To install pre-commit simply run inside the shell:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

pre-commit is very useful to check your code before publishing it.
It's configured using .pre-commit-config.yaml file.

By default it runs:
* mypy (validates types);
* ruff (spots possible bugs);

## Migrations

If you want to migrate your database, you should run following commands:
```bash
# To run all migrations until the migration with revision_id.
alembic upgrade "<revision_id>"

# To perform all pending migrations.
alembic upgrade "head"
```

### Reverting migrations

If you want to revert migrations, you should run:
```bash
# revert all migrations up to: revision_id.
alembic downgrade <revision_id>

# Revert everything.
 alembic downgrade base
```

### Migration generation

To generate migrations you should run:
```bash
# For automatic change detection.
alembic revision --autogenerate

# For empty file generation.
alembic revision
```


## Running tests

If you want to run it in docker, simply run:

```bash
docker compose run --build --rm api pytest -vv .
docker compose down
```

For running tests on your local machine.
1. you need to start all aux services.

We can do so by using our `docker-compose.yaml` configuration. It already has everything we need.

```bash
docker compose up -d --wait db
```

2. Run tests.
```bash
pytest -vv .
```
